        <h1>Monad Superboard</h1>
        <p>The Monad protocol delivers full EVM compatibility with breakthrough performance and true decentralization.
        </p>

    <article class="sass-description">
        <h2>Low hardware requirements</h2>
        <p>MonadDB allows you to store most of the state on SSD instead of RAM. This significantly reduces RAM
            requirements and reduces the cost of running a node— creating a clear path to scalable decentralization.</p>

        <h2>Reinventing the Layer 1 Blockchain</h2>
        <p>Monad ushers in a new paradigm of blockchain technology. Rebuilt from the ground up to be the most efficient
            chain in the world— all while being 100% EVM compatible.</p>

        <h2>Work and play with what you've got.</h2>
        <p>With Monad, developers, users, and researchers can reuse the wealth of existing applications, libraries,
            addresses and applied cryptography research that have all been built for the EVM.</p>

        <h2>Extreme Scalability</h2>
        <p>Take advantage of 10,000 TPS, 0.4s block times, 800ms finality and near zero gas fees for extreme scalability
            while maintaining your existing Solidity codebase.</p>

        <h2>Scalable Decentralization</h2>
        <p>Monad's low hardware requirements allow consumer-grade hardware to sufficiently run nodes— creating a clear
            path to decentralization.</p>

        <h2>Redesigning the EVM</h2>
        <p>Monad is a redesign of both the consensus and execution systems of Ethereum that preserves compatibility for
            EVM smart contracts and Ethereum’s RPC API.
